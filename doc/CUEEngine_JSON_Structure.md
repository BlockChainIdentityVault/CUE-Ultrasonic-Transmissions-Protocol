# Structure of CUEEngine got-message-callback JSON payload

## Basic Terms

A ***symbol*** is an integer between `0` and `461`.

Each time a CUE ***message*** is detected, a JSON payload is returned to your application within the `ReceiverCallback` block. An example payload is provided below. 

The _message_ is encoded in the `"raw-indices"` field as one or more _symbols_ separated by `"."`.  e.g. `"42"`, `"1.2.3.4.461"`.  It is either a ***trigger*** _message_ or a ***data*** _message_.

(**NOTE**: _For basic CUE integration, the `"raw-indices"` field alone is sufficient. However, for advanced techniques (such as device synchronization), additional fields may be of use._)

A standard ***trigger message*** comprises 3 symbols  e.g. `"1.2.3"`. 

In a _data message_, each _symbol_ represents a raw ASCII character (so only symbols `0-255` are used). 

The symbols detected are always contained within the `raw-indices` parameter. An example is: `314.113.249`

## **Description**

### Basic Parameters

Each payload has a `"mode"` (`"trigger"`, `"live"` or  `"data"`).  Particular `"modes"`  are appropriate for certain situations. 

(**NOTE:** _The standard profile is `"trigger"` mode. Unless stated otherwise, a this mode should be assumed._)

- `"mode"`:
    1. `"trigger"`:

		_Intended for transmitting content IDs or small amounts of data over short to long distances. For a 3-symbol trigger, each payload consists of a three-symbol ID (each symbol ranging from 0 to 461), and can easily transmit throughout a 20,000 person arena. Example: `421.379.49`._

        • _bandwidth_: 26 bits  
        • _latency_: ~1.0 seconds  
    
    2. `"live"`:

		_Ultra low-latency detection of one-symbol payloads (`< 0.03` seconds). Payload consists of a single symbol. Example: `421`. For `live` triggers, latency is prioritized over accuracy._ 

        _bandwidth_: 8.5 bits  
        _latency_: ~0.03 seconds
    
    3. `"data"`:

		_For transmitting arbitrarily large data payloads across short to medium distances. Transmission occurs at a rate of 100bps. Payload size varies according to signal duration. Example: `421.379.49.55.409.392`._

        _bandwidth_: 100 bits/sec  
        _latency_: **N/A** (notification once entire message received)

- `"latency_ms"`:

    Time in milliseconds since *start* of the trigger?


- `"raw-indices"`:

    The "symbol string" or "indices" of the detected trigger (e.g., `"1.2.3"`).

### Advanced Parameters

The following parameters are only needed for advanced metrics, such as estimating distance from the audio source. 

- `"power"`:

    Log (base 10) of the median channel strength and noise level


- `"noise"`:

    Log (base 10) of the median background noise level

- If `"disable_nearest_match" : false` in `engine-config`:

    + `"winner-indices"`:

        Indices of winner (e.g., `"1.2.3"`)
        If the engine is informed (via CUE's API) to only listen for a subset of triggers (rather than all possible triggers), if the detected trigger nearly (but not exactly) matches a trigger from the set supplied, the engine will return modified indices to match a signal from the initial set. Otherwise, `raw-indices` are returned. For this reason, 

    + `"scores"`

        List of similarity-measure of this trigger with universe of triggers we're listening for

    + `"winner-binary"`:

        Binary of winner (e.g., `"11111000000.00011111000.00000011111"``)

    + `"error"`

        Closeness. `0.0` is a perfect match
else:
    `"winner-indices"`:
        same as `"raw-indices"`

**NOTE:** _It is recommended to use `"winner-indices"` rather than `"raw-indices"`._

- If `"calib_symbol" : false` in `engine-config`:
    + `"raw-trigger"`:
        + For each symbol in the trigger:
            + Raw FFT-bin level for the signal strength of each of the 11 channels
- else:
    + `"raw-calib"`: 
        + Raw FFT-bin level for the signal strength of each of the 11 channels of the (initial) `calibration symbol`.

    + `"raw-trigger"`:
        + For each symbol in the trigger:
            + Raw FFT-bin level for the signal strength of each of the 11 channels *divided by* the corresponding value in `"raw-calib"` (i.e., normalized/calibrated).
